## About IQ24.ai

**IQ24.ai is an open-source, AI-native B2B prospecting and outreach platform designed to transform how businesses approach growth.** We are building a sophisticated multi-agent system that automates and augments the entire sales and marketing lifecycle, from identifying the perfect prospect to crafting hyper-personalized, multi-channel outreach that converts.

Our mission is to move beyond traditional, reactive sales tools and build a proactive, predictive engine that empowers B2B teams to work smarter, not harder.
